# frozen_string_literal: true

# Handles the processing of requests before they reach the controller action method itself.
# All global before_actions should go here.
# The basic flow is:
#
# - Authenticate via token if action was prepended.
# - Check subdomain validity and set current_community.
# - Store the requested URL in case auth fails.
# - Authenticate user via session unless already authenticated.
# - Redirect to an appropriate subdomain or 404 if subdomain missing and this filter not skipped.
# - Ensure the current_user has access to the current_community if both set.
# - Set the current tenant (cluster) based on the current community.
